# Drive-Safe

### _How might we create greater road safety and a more uniform pass rate for new drivers?_

## What
Drive Safe is a self-driving car software that replaces the driving instructor with a highly-responsive, safety-focused artificial intelligence. Learner drivers take lessons alone by following the instructions given to them by the car.

During the lesson, the car accurately measures and logs the driver's:
- speed
- control
- response time
- ability to follow instructions.

At the end of the lesson, the driver is given a score, a list of things to work on, and a video recording of any trouble spots, complete with an audio explanation. 

If the driver ever becomes a danger to themself or others during the lesson, the car takes back control and returns the driver to the pick up point. 

## How
Drive Safe combines:
- Cameras and proximity sensors 
– Real-time GPS
- Machine learning
– Speech

## Why
Self-driving cars are almost here. In the distant future, most people won't drive. But in the near term, millions of people will continue to drive alongside fully-automated self-driving cars. It's important that these human drivers are all of the highest possible standard. 

Safe Drive ensures that drivers are of a high standard by giving more accurate, unbiased and reliable scoring, both in driving lessons and tests.

By using Safe Drive, learner drivers enjoy:
- a more consistent learning experience 
– the safety of a tutor with greater response time, greater control and awareness
- less pressure, nerves and anxiety than with a human driver
- More affordable lessons
– Real-time location tracking by parents or loved ones.
